                  My name is Thomas Rivas-Siles and I am from the Washington, DC area (Silver Spring to be exact) with peruvian descent(both of my parents are peruvian). I just moved to Portland to become an Epicodus student. Before this I had graduated from the University of Maryland with a double major in International Business and Marketing in 2015. Right after graduating I had founded my own startup called Vendoo, which is a tool for online sellers that allows them to easily post and manage items on multiple sites all from their phone. This was what propelled me into the tech world and made me so interested in learning how to program. Besides programming and working on my business I love to travel. I have been to 11 countries so far but have many more I want to visit. I would love to do a trip through Europe in 2018 and in Russia for the World Cup. </strong>
